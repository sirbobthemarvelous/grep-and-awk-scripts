#    p "Though it hasn't been explicitly stated, I think I've made it clear through pronoun usage and general presentation of these characters that they are all non-binary."

#    p "They also all share a similar trajectory in that they are all from the sort of galactic back water, and traveled to live in the diamond sector, the Galaxy's cultural center."

#    p "So already we have three people with some pretty similar sensibilities, so when picking each of their names, well, of course I focused on theming first."

#    p "But there is this phenomenon in trans and non-binary chosen names, where people will often gravitate to the same set of names."

#    p "For instance, lilly is a stereotypical chosen name for a trans woman, elliot for trans men, and non-binary people often name themselves after objects like... socks, or, rock. (I'm being dead serious)"

#    p "So I liked the Idea that with this demographic of space faring non-binary bears, that they tend to name themselves after cosmological events."

#    p "But not just like, any cosmic event, but specifically the ones you could witness from a planet."

#    p "I thought that for a group of people to whom space travel is mundane, that simple cosmic events would feel more intimate. like a pretty tree in your back yard."

#    p "Since Dawn, Dusk, and Eclipse all share such humble origins, I like to imagine they chose their names to honor the memory of their home world."

#    p "It's a truly ever present trope in fiction and media in general, and I'll give it consideration when it comes to timing, or repetition, but-"

#    p "Without really planning it, threes became an important part of how I tell this story, how I communicate and develop character relationships, and also in the very construction of each character."
